   <h1>7 Businesses in Downtown Columbia</h1>
<div id="opening">
   <h5>Downtown Columbia, Mo., is known for its wide range of businesses catering to all kinds of people. These are, in my opinion, some of the best ones that I’ve found during my time as a student of Mizzou, located right beside the downtown area.</h5>

      <p><i>Poppy, Made by Hand</i> is an excellent shop if you’re looking for a gift for a loved one or yourself! There’s a wide variety of products and it’s on the more expensive side, but it’s all high-quality items. From posters and stationery to amazing handmade jewelry, even candles, soaps, and other bath products. Nearly all of their products, especially ceramics and pottery, are acquired from local artists.</p>

      <p>This local business is a non-profit volunteer-based shop under the <i>Peaceworks</i> organization in Columbia. The products sold are almost all handmade by local artists and are centered around sustainability. It definitely has that hippie vibe, but it’s a great atmosphere. You will feel very welcome every time you go here.</p>

</div> 
      <p><i>Iron Moe’s</i> is a relatively new tattoo shop above Broadway Brewery. Opened by Moe himself, there are a total of two licensed artists and three apprentices under them. They specialize in fine-line tattoos and have a very simplistic design feel to all of their projects. I got my first tattoo here and I’m trying to go back from another. The atmosphere is great and I recommend it for anyone getting their first tattoo as well.</p>

   <h2>Shortwave Coffee</h2>
           <address>
            915 Alley A, <br>
            Columbia, MO 65201<br>

</div> 
      <p>While I haven’t been to this location much, it’s a great place to go with friends. I favor the 9th Street location as it’s easy to pop in an out, but the atmosphere that the Alley A location provides is very unique. I love Shortwave coffee. They always have such high quality espresso and have unique drink recipes. As a barista myself, I appreciate a good espresso pull with a different recipe. The Alley A location is located in this area that makes it feel like an industrial basement. There aren’t any windows which provides a moodier setting and they play soft music to pair it with.</p>
