	<h2>The Lunar Chronicles Series</h2>
	<h3>By Marissa Meyer</h3>
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cinder-Book-One-Lunar-Chronicles/dp/1250768888/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=cinder+marissa+meyer&qid=1677776496&sprefix=cinder+m%2Caps%2C331&sr=8-1">Get the book on Amazon</a>
	<p>Humans and androids crowd the raucous streets of New Beijing. A deadly plague ravages the population. From space, a ruthless lunar people watch, waiting to make their move. No one knows that Earth's fate hinges on one girl...</p>

	<p>Cinder, a gifted mechanic, is a cyborg. She's a second-class citizen with a mysterious past, reviled by her stepmother and blamed for her stepsister's illness. But when her life becomes intertwined with the handsome Prince Kai's, she suddenly finds herself at the center of an intergalactic struggle, and a forbidden attraction. Caught between duty and freedom, loyalty and betrayal, she must uncover secrets about her past in order to protect her world's future.</p>

	<p>With high-stakes action and a smart, resourceful heroine, Cinder is a Cinderella retelling that is at once classic and strikingly original. <i>- Amazon</i></p>

	<p>This was one of the series that shaped my adolescence. <i>The Lunar Chronicles</i> was and still is one of my all-time favorite book series. If you like whimsical science fiction crossed over with Disney retellings, this is the series for you. Marissa Meyer is a wonderful author, and you will see more of her books on this list.</p>
	<p>Each book in the four-part series are retellings of classic stories. <i>Cinder</i> is based off of <i>Cinderella</i>, <i>Scarlet</i> is <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, <i>Cress</i> is <i>Rapunzel</i> and <i>Winter</i> is <i>Snow White</i>.</p>

	<h2>Paranormalcy</h2>
	<h3>By Kiersten White</h3>
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paranormalcy-Kiersten-White/dp/0061985848/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1677776729&sr=8-1">Get the book on Amazon</a>
	<p>Evie’s always thought of herself as a normal teenager, even though she works for the International Paranormal Containment Agency, her ex-boyfriend is a faerie, she’s falling for a shapeshifter, and she’s the only person who can see through paranormals’ glamours. But Evie’s about to realize that she may very well be at the center of a dark faerie prophecy promising destruction to all paranormal creatures.</p> 
	<p>So much for normal. <i>- Amazon</i></p>
	<p><i>The Paranormalcy Trilogy</i> series was one of my favorites in middle school. It had the great adventure of a prophecy and the main characters trying to defy it, as well as a great romance between Lend and Evie. While now I think it is a little juvenile, the thought of this series always excites me. Kiersten White was the first author I recognized by name because of this series and brought me into the strong female protagonist while still playing that part of teenage girl. This series consists of three books: <i>Paranormalcy</i>, <i>Supernaturally</i> and <i>Endlessly</i>.</p>

	<h2>The Renegades Trilogy</h2>
	<h3>By Marissa Meyer</h3>
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Renegades-Marissa-Meyer/dp/1250044669/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1677776751&sr=8-3">Get the book on Amazon</a>
	<p><i>Secret Identities. Extraordinary Powers. She wants vengeance. He wants justice.</i></p>
	<p>The Renegades are a syndicate of prodigies―humans with extraordinary abilities―who emerged from the ruins of a crumbled society and established peace and order where chaos reigned. As champions of justice, they remain a symbol of hope and courage to everyone...except the villains they once overthrew.</p>
	<p>Nova has a reason to hate the Renegades, and she is on a mission for vengeance. As she gets closer to her target, she meets Adrian, a Renegade boy who believes in justice―and in Nova. But Nova's allegiance is to the villains who have the power to end them both. <i>- Amazon</i></p>
	<p><i>Renegades</i> is a series that I am currently reading. I started the trilogy in high school and have been ever-so-slowly working on finishing it. There are three books in the series: <i>Renegades</i>, <i>Archenemies</i> and <i>Supernova</i>. Again, I cannot stress my love for Marissa Meyer’s books. Every book I have read of hers has sucked me into the universe fully every time and the plots are so amazingly written.</p>

	<p>When Captain Shang is mortally wounded by Shan Yu in battle, Mulan must travel to the Underworld, Diyu, in order to save him from certain death. But King Yama, the ruler of Diyu, is not willing to give Shang up easily. With the help of Shang's great lion guardian ShiShi, Mulan must traverse Diyu to find Shang's spirit, face harrowing obstacles, and leave by sunrise--or become King Yama's prisoner forever. </p>
	<p>Moreover, Mulan is still disguised as the soldier called Ping, wrestling with the decision to reveal her true identity to her closest friend. Will Mulan be able to save Shang before it's too late? Will he ever be able to trust her again? Or will she lose him--and be lost in the Underworld--forever? <i>- Amazon</i></p>
	<p><i>Reflection</i> is another Disney retelling. This time, however, it’s produced by Disney in a collaborative series called A Twisted Tale with various authors. Lim also wrote <i>So This Is Love</i> for <i>Cinderella</i> and <i>When You Wish Upon a Star</i> for <i>Pinocchio</i>. Elizabeth Lim’s research on Chinese culture, myths and legends greatly helped the story, as well as her heritage as a Chinese-American.</p>

	<h2>The Hunger Games Trilogy</h2>
	<h3>Suzanne Collins</h3>
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Games-Book/dp/0439023483/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hunger+games+book+1&qid=1677776804&sprefix=hunger+games%2Caps%2C123&sr=8-1">Get the book on Amazon</a>
	<p>In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. </p>
	<p>Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. <i>- Amazon</i></p>
	<p>To be fair, I did watch the movie before I read the series, but the movie was what made me read it. I watched the movie around the time it first came out and loved it. So, when I found out it was based off a book, I had to read it. Luckily, it was the big book series for our school and almost teacher had a copy along with our actual school library as well. I finished the series fairly quickly from what I can recall, but it was a great read. I’d love it re-read it, too, to better encapsulate the horrors of the book because I’m not too sure I could fully comprehend why it was such an intense series back then.</p>

	<p>She won't rest until she's sent every walking corpse back to its grave. Forever.</p>

	<p>Had anyone told Alice Bell that her entire life would change course between one heartbeat and the next, she would have laughed. From blissful to tragic, innocent to ruined? Please. But that's all it took. One heartbeat. A blink, a breath, a second, and everything she knew and loved was gone.</p>

	<p>Her father was right. The monsters are real.</p>

	<p>To avenge her family, Ali must learn to fight the undead. To survive, she must learn to trust the baddest of the bad boys, Cole Holland. But Cole has secrets of his own, and if Ali isn't careful, those secrets might just prove to be more dangerous than the zombies. <i>- Amazon</i></p>
	<p><i>Alice in Zombieland</i> is a four-part book series and the first big series of Gena Showalter. In high school, this was the series I went through. While <i>The Lunar Chronicles</i> was my middle school series, this was my "grown-up" era series. It was more intense and pretty graphic in terms of zombie-killing scenes. This series also exposed me to my first (nondescriptive) smut scene in a book, which is funnier than anything. I wasn't expecting it and was reading it in class, and I think I completely skipped over it.</p>
	<p>The <i>White Rabbit Chronicles</i> includes <i>Alice in Zombieland</i>, <i>Through the Zombie Glass</i>, <i>The Queen of Zombie Hearts</i> and <i>A Mad Zombie Party</i>.</p>

	<p>Some things are permanent. Indelible. And they cannot be changed back.

	<p>Joy Malone learns this the night she sees a stranger with all-black eyes across a crowded room—right before the mystery boy tries to cut out her eye. Instead, the wound accidentally marks her as property of Indelible Ink, and this dangerous mistake thrusts Joy into an incomprehensible world—a world of monsters at the window, glowing girls on the doorstep and a life that will never be the same.</p>

	<p>Now, Joy must pretend to be Ink's chosen one—his helper, his love, his something for the foreseeable future…and failure to be convincing means a painful death for them both. Swept into a world of monsters, illusion, immortal honor and revenge, Joy discovers that sometimes, there are no mistakes.</p>

	<p>Somewhere between reality and myth lies… <i>- Amazon</i></p>
	<p>To be honest, this is the one book on this list I remember the least. I read the first book in seventh grade, but never continued the series simply because at the time, the series was brand new, and the next book wouldn't come out for another year. By then, I had moved onto my next series. However, it was still a book story. I enjoyed it immensely when I did read it. Time was the enemy in this instance.</p> 
	<p><i>The Twixt Series</i> is a four-part series including <i>Indelible</i>, <i>Invisible</i>, <i>Insidious</i> and <i>Invincible</i>.</p>
